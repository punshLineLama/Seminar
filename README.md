# Seminar
<h1>A Repository for my seminar-paper and the code which I used to conduct an experiment</h1>

The C program <i>performance.c</i> depicts how the performace was measured during the experiment.<br>
It was once compiled with the flags: <b>-fno-stackprotect -O0<b> and once with <b> -fstack-protector-all -O0</b> <br>

The python script <i>condfidenceInterval.py</i> was then used to calculate the confidence intervals of the output of <i> performance.c </i>

For further details, take a look at the seminar-paper itself.
