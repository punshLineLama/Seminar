# Seminar
<p> <h3>A Repository for my seminar-paper and the code which I used to conduct an experiment</h3></p>

<p>The C program <b>performance.c</b> depicts how the performace was measured during the experiment.<br>
It was once compiled with the flags: <code>-fno-stackprotect -O0</code> and once with <code> -fstack-protector-all -O0</code> <br>

The python script <b>confidenceInterval.py</b> was then used to calculate the confidence intervals of the output of <b> performance.c </b>

For further details, take a look at the seminar-paper itself. </p>
